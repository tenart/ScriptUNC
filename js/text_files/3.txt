<h1>Teaching Rameses To React</h1>
<br><br>
You can have Rameses perform specific functions after completing a move by defining a function variable. 
<br>
For example:
<br>
<pre>

var announcement = function() {
	alert(“I finished moving!”);
}

rameses.moveUpAndDo(5, announcement);

</pre>
<br>

After Rameses moves up 5 spaces, the announcement function will execute and Rameses will announce that he has finished moving!

<br>

You can also tell Rameses what to do if he hits a wall. For example: 

<br>

<pre>

var hitWall = function() {
	alert(“I hit a wall!”);
}

rameses.setCollisionReaction(hitWall);

</pre>
<br>

Now, every time Rameses runs into a wall, he will alert that he hit a wall.
