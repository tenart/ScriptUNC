<h1>Lesson Three: Functions</h1>
<br>
<br>
A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.This is a way you define a function:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
var add = function(a,b){
	return a + b;
};
</pre>
<br>
<br>
If you write the function into the "myFunctions.js" tab, you could then use it in the "myScript.js tab". Write the function into the appropirate tab and then try out a couple of these in "myScript.js" and see what happens.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
rameses.alert("I am "+add(10,10)+" years old");
rameses.moveUp(add(2,3));
rameses.moveRight(add(1,1));
</pre>
<br>
<br>
We will discuss how these lines of code work in later lessons. For now just marvel in awe at the magic that is computer programming.
