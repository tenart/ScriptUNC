<h1>Lesson Six: Functions Inside Functions</h1>
<br>
<br>
Not all functions will have just return values, some of them will contain other functions as well. A good example of this is the Fibonacci sequence.
<br><br>
<pre>
var fib = function(aNumber){

  if(aNumber === 0){
  return 0;
  }
  else if(aNumber === 1){
  return 1;
  }
  else{
  return fib(aNumber-1) + fib(aNumber-2);
  }
}
</pre>
<br><br>
This could also be done if you want to call another function that you have already created. For example, if you wanted to make a function that multiplied a number by 2, you could use the add function to add it twice and return you that value, which you could use for something else.
<br><br>
<pre>
var multby2 = function(aNumber){
  return add(aNumber,aNumber);
}
</pre>
<br><br>
