<h1>Lesson One: "Hello World"</h1>
<br>
"Hello World" is a program that most programmers learn
before they do any acutal programming. Think of it as a rite of passage into programming!
<br>
<br>
For your first program, you are going to make the browser display an alert message. To do that, type the following into <code>myScript.js</code> using the code editor:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
alert("Hello World");
</pre>
<br>
The <code>alert()</code> method will display whatever you put between the parenthesis.  After doing this you will have written your first bit of code as a programmer.
